Business Problem
-

Imagine that you are asked to build a model to predict the criticality level of a person coming for health insurance. This criticality factor is important to fix the premium.	
	
Instructions	
-
	
This is a code based exam and you have to make sure that the following points are taken into consideration seriously:	
	
1. You can use either PyTorch or Keras but YOU  HAVE TO USE DEEP LEARNING CONCEPTS.

2. There are missing values available in the dataset. Missing values available in the employment related variables needs to be imputed but missing values in the other variables are legit.

3. Take out LAST 10000 ROWS AS VALIDATION DATASET.

Extra problem
-
	
- Based on your model which criticality level is difficult to predict (based on validation data).
- What is the F1 score for the criticality level 5 (based on validation data).
	
	
Entire model building process would carry 35 marks. Last two extra questions will carry 5 marks.
